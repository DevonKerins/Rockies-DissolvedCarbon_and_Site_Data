The United State Geological Surveyâ€™s (USGS) National Water Information system (NWIS) compiles water data and stores it long-term. It can be accessed through the publicly available portal, Water Data for the Nation. The USGS collects and analyzes discharge, chemical, physical, and biological properties of water from across the nation. The USGS provides samples from over 420,000 sites and daily data from ~15,000 sites (U.S. Geological Survey, 2021). Stream gage discharge and dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) were retrieved from this database using the USGS-R dataRetrieval package (De Cicco, Lorenz, Hirsch, Watkins, & Johnson, 2018).

The Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow, version II, (GAGES-II) provides geospatial data and classifications for USGS stream gages that are in the United States. This dataset compliments 9,322 gages included in NWIS. To be included in GAGES-II the stream gages must have either 20+ complete years (not necessarily continuous) of discharge record since 1950 or are currently active, as of water year 2009 (Falcone, 2011).

***This page includes the calculated mean discharge, carbon concentrations, climate data, and catchment attributes from NWIS and GAGES-II used in Kerins & Li, (2022).***
